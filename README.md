Reverse-engineering TP-Link TL-WR850N to unlock networking capabilities...


### üîì Firmware & OS Customization:
OpenWRT Installation: Unlock Linux-based control with advanced routing, firewall, and monitoring options.

DD-WRT Installation: Enhance stability, QoS, VPN capabilities, and wireless range.

Tomato Firmware: Focused on bandwidth monitoring and VPN support with a smooth GUI.

LEDE Project: Lightweight Linux distribution specifically for routers‚Äîgood for experimenting with custom networking scripts.

### üì∂ Network Expansion & Enhancement:
Repeater Mode: Extend your main Wi-Fi signal to dead zones.

Mesh Network Node: Add it to a mesh setup for broader Wi-Fi coverage.

Bridge Mode: Connect multiple networks without subnet conflicts.

Power over Ethernet (PoE): Experiment with PoE injectors for remote placement without power outlets.

### üîê Security & Penetration Testing:
VPN Gateway (OpenVPN/WireGuard): Encrypt all traffic through your router.

Firewall Customization: Advanced control over port forwarding, NAT, and DMZ settings.

HoneyPot Setup: Lure potential attackers for study in a safe, isolated network environment.

WPA3 Handshake Capture: Practice Wi-Fi penetration testing legally within your network.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Monitoring & Analytics:
Network Traffic Sniffing: Use tcpdump or Wireshark to capture and analyze traffic.

Bandwidth Control & Monitoring: Limit specific users, devices, or services.

Local DNS Server: Speed up hostname resolution with a custom DNS cache.

Real-time Network Mapping: Visualize all connected devices and their communication.

### ü§ñ Automation & IoT Experiments:
IoT Gateway: Manage smart home devices with better isolation and monitoring.

Home Automation Hub: Integrate with Home Assistant or OpenHAB for smart control.

### üß™ Development & Experimentation:
Embedded Linux Development: Practice writing scripts for Linux-based routers.

Captive Portal Setup: Create a custom login page for guests with data logging.
